    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        We invite individuals or teams interested in organizing such a workshop to submit proposals that will work well in an online format for IEEE VR 2021. Since IEEE VR 2021 is going to be fully virtual, we are encouraging workshop submissions that fit well with an online format that maximizes engagement. Although longer workshops will be considered, we encourage shorter efficient workshops, or workshops split over sessions spanning two or more days with long breaks between sessions in order reduce video-conference fatigue and to provide attendees time to reflect between sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workshops are intended to bring together researchers, developers, technology providers, practitioners and users for a lively and interactive discussion of issues through an informal exchange of ideas and information. Workshops may target a specific application area, a specific research area, or a topic of general interest. Workshops should be more than just a mini conference of paper presentations. Workshops may include, but are not limited to:
