    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 28th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2021 seeks research demonstrations from laboratories or research groups (academic, government, or industry). Demos should interest the broad XR community and be presentable in a conference setting exhibiting new and innovative work. The conference will provide basic infrastructure. Additionally, authors of accepted demos will present an overview in a fast-forward research demonstration session to summarize their demo and relate it to research being performed at their lab.
    </p>


    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        A demo proposal should include:
        <ul>
            <li>A two-page extended abstract in PDF format describing the demo and the research itself. This will be published in the conference proceedings. Please provide the abstract in IEEE format, see below.</li>
            <li>A schematic of the layout (a separate document detailing the size and showing components such as projectors, cameras, etc. and describing any special support needed).</li>
            <li>A video showing the demo in action (the URL should be included in the proposal â€“ preferably YouTube or Vimeo). This video could also be submitted to the IEEE Videos Track for separate consideration. (Please refer to the IEEE Videos Call for formatting and deadlines.)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The submission should clearly describe the overall architecture of the system or technology demonstrated. Authors should put great emphasis on the work's motivation, applications, and novelty. The description should also explain how the audience can interact with the demo. Submissions need not be anonymized but may be if the authors prefer. Abstracts for accepted demos will be included in the conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, so they must follow the IEEE Computer Society format at <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accepted demos must be up and running during dedicated demo sessions and lunch breaks. It is further appreciated if they run at other times (e.g., coffee breaks), but that is not required for acceptance.
    </p>


    <h2 id="online-presentation">Online Presentation</h2>
    <p>
        IEEE VR 2021 will be a fully virtual conference. For the presentation of the research demos, we will use Discord. For each demo, there will be a text channel for discussions and a multimedia channel to present live demos using the video conferencing capabilities of Discord. We will require you to present your demo as a live demo in case of acceptance. In addition, demos will be presented (together with posters) in a fast forward session using a 30 sec. video, which should be provided at a later point in the process.
    </p>
