    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the IEEE VR 2021 Mentorship Program is to connect newcomers to the conference (mentees) and experienced attendees (mentors) via shared interests. This program is a great networking opportunity for both mentees and mentors to learn both about each other and the VR field in general!
    </p>
    
    <h2>How do I participate?</h2>
    <p>
        Interested individuals can opt-in to the Mentorship Program after registering for the 2021 IEEE VR conference. Mentors and mentees will be matched by the program organizers based on different levels of IEEE VR experience and research interests and will be put in contact before the conference begins.
    </p>
    <p> 
        A sign-up form will be shared with <strong>all registered attendees</strong> of the IEEE VR 2021 conference. Interested participants should complete this form by <strong>March 20, 2021</strong>. This deadline is to give time for the committee to match mentors and mentees before the conference begins.
