        <strong>IEEE VR 2021</strong> is striving towards an inclusive and accessible environment to encourage conference participation by individuals of all identities and with diverse backgrounds. This page describes some of the accessibility and support features of IEEE VR 2021, to help you make an informed decision about whether the conference will be accessible to you and to better plan your attendance. This yearâ€™s conference will be held entirely online, using some tools and platforms that are different from last yearâ€™s conference. We try to anticipate all potential needs from the VR community. However, if the conference arrangements are not sufficient to allow you to attend, or if you have any question that is not answered here, please contact us at diversity2021[at]ieeevr.org (see below for more information). We are open to any suggestions and feedback.
