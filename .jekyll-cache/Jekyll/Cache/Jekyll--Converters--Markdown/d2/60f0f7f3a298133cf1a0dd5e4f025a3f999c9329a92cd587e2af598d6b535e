                The encouraged Presentation format in the DC is a Pecha Kucha style in which 20 slides are shown for 20 seconds each. Each student will have a seven minute time frame for presenting.  Even if a student choses not to adhere to the 20 slides/20 seconds, <a style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #00aeef; color: #00aeef; -webkit-text-decoration-color:#00aeef;">the time frame of seven minutes is a firm limit</a>. This will be followed by 4-5 minutes of QA from the audience. Please plan and practice in advance to ensure that we stay on schedule.

    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The DC is a concentrated full-day event that will be held on <strong>Sunday, March 28th, 2021</strong>, where students present their research interests/plans/results to a panel of researchers in the field and receive specific constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive constructive comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster about their work to allow IEEE VR attendees to quickly familiarize themselves with each otherâ€™s work and to be shown to a broader audience during the conference poster session. Accepted students will have the option to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the online IEEE VR program. There is also the possibility that the abstracts may be archived in the IEEExplore digital library.
    </p>
