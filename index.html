        Latest information for traveling to Shanghai. In China, the covid-19 controlling policy has been almost completely relaxed since Dec.7,2022.
        The omicron virus is treated similarly as flu now. From Jan.8,2023, international traveling to China is much more convenient, only needing a nucleic 
        acid test within 48 hours before flight departures and no other controls. 
        Here is <a href="http://sanfrancisco.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/zytz/202212/t20221227_10995733.htm"> a reference official link to the latest 
        traveling policy to China.</a>. For more details, please consult Chinese consulate in your local region.      
        
        In Shanghai, the situation is now gradually becoming as stable and normal as in other countries. 
        People in China are now getting used to the new status and gradually resume back to work and life as similar to the status before 2019.

    <!-- <p>
        The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation in Shanghai
        and the uncertainty around International travel, the decision has been made to transform the in-person component of IEEE VR 2023 into an 
        all-digital conference experience and will now be an online event. Therefore, IEEE VR 2023 will no longer take place in Pudong, Shanghai and will instead take place virtually. The conference dates remain the same (25 – 29 March 2023). Proceedings will not be cancelled, 
        and publications will continue as planned.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        IEEE VR 2023, the 30th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces will be held from March 25th through March 29th, 2023 at the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel in Shanghai, China.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to provide the best hybrid conference experience for physical and virtual attendees,  learning from the historical footsteps of the successfull physical or virtual experience of <a href={{ "/past-conferences/" | relative_url }}>past IEEE VR conferences</a>.

        <!-- Our goal is to provide the best experience for virtual attendees, following in the historical footsteps of the virtual experience of 
        <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2021/">VR 2021 in Lisbon</a> and <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2022/">VR 2022 in New Zealand</a>. -->
    </p>
    
    <!-- <p>
        We are still hoping to run a small meeting hub in Shanghai for those who are able to travel locally. More information will be 
        provided once available.
    </p> -->

    <p>
        Come join us for an unforgettable experience and explore the virtuality continuum in the premier event covering extended reality 
        featuring oral presentations, posters, research demos, tutorials, and workshops.
