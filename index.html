                Due to the severe weather conditions in the USA, posting the registration form is delayed, since the support team is operating out of Dallas, TX. We expect the form to be up early next week. Thank you very much for your patience and understanding.

    <h1>Come and Join Us</h1>

    <p>
        The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation in New Zealand 
        and the uncertainty around International travel, the decision has been made to transform the in-person component of IEEE VR 2022 into an 
        all-digital conference experience and will now be an online event. Therefore, IEEE VR 2022 will no longer take place in Christchurch, New 
        Zealand and will instead take place virtually. The conference dates remain the same (12 â€“ 16 March 2022). Proceedings will not be cancelled, 
        and publications will continue as planned.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to provide the best experience for virtual attendees, following in the historical footsteps of the virtual experience of 
        <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2020/">VR 2020 in Atlanta</a> and <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2021/">VR 2021 in Lisbon</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We are still hoping to run a small meeting hub in Christchurch for those who are able to travel locally. More information will be 
        provided once available.
    </p>

    <p>
        Come join us for an unforgettable experience and explore the virtuality continuum in the premier event covering extended reality 
        featuring oral presentations, posters, research demos, tutorials, and workshops.
    </p>

    <p>
        Present your latest and greatest work at IEEE VR 2022 in Christchurch, New Zealand. This will be the first time that IEEE VR is held not 
        only in Australasia but in the entire Southern Hemisphere. Christchurch is one of the main centres in New Zealand and the largest city 
        of and gateway to New Zealand's South Island. The New York Times named Christchurch one of 52 places to visit in 2020 as it stands out as 
        a global symbol of resilience. Christchurch is focused on the future, with new ideas and new thinking creating a fresh focus of exploration 
        and innovation. In recent years it has been completely redeveloped, resulting in the construction of 
        <a href="https://www.tepae.co.nz/">Te Pae</a>, the new conference centre where we will hold the conference from 
        12<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> March 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation to determine if the in-person IEEE VR experience will be both safe and 
        feasible due to international travel restrictions. The conference will be a hybrid event, with our goal to provide the best
        experience for both in-person and virtual attendees following in the historical footsteps of the Virtual Experience of 
        . 
        Come join us for an unforgettable experience and explore the virtuality continuum in the premier event covering 
        extended reality featuring oral presentations, posters, research demos, tutorials, and workshops.
