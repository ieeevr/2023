keynote-mohler,Betty Mohler,Amazon Research Development Center,Self-avatars in Immersive Technology,"Monday, 29 March, 2021",10:30,11:30,WEST UTC+1,"Betty Mohler joined Amazon in 2018 as a Principal Research Scientist at the Amazon Research Development Center. However, the research of this presentation was conducted prior to Betty Mohler’s position at Amazon and therefore does not reflect her research or future work at Amazon. The research she will be discussing considers the physical, experienced and visual body of the user. In her talk at the IEEE VR Conference, Mohler will discuss the benefits and challenges of adding self-avatars to immersive technology, based on her research reports about how self-avatars are central to enabling personalized and immersive experiences and also how the human body should be carefully considered when designing immersive technology.","Betty Mohler has over 100 research articles published on space and body perception, virtual humans, and virtual reality. Betty joined Amazon in 2018 as a Principal Research Scientist at the Amazon Research Development Center. Previously, she was a Professor at the Cognitive Science Center at Technical University of Darmstadt, and for ten years she was an Independent Research Group Leader of “Space and Body Research Group” at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. At TU Darmstadt, the Max Planck Institutes and at the University of Utah (where Betty received her PhD in computer science), she had the privilege of working with world-renowned experts in multi-disciplinary teams focused on Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, Computer Vision, Philosophy of Neuroscience, and Neural Behavioral Science. Betty and her research teams have always focused equally on human perception, as well as developing immersive technology. Her passion for developing virtual reality for medical, clinical and industrial applications, along with a central focus on the person led her to a primary research focus of “Self-avatars in Immersive Technology”.",http://ieeevr.org/2021/assets/images/keynotes/keynote-mohler.jpg,Ming Lin

keynote-steinicke,Frank Steinicke,University of Hamburg,B(l)ending Realities,"Wednesday, 31 March, 2021",11:00,12:00,WEST UTC+1,"The fusion of mixed reality (MR) and artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionize human-computer interaction. MR/AI technologies and methods will enable scenarios with seamless transitions, interactions and transformations between real and virtual objects along the reality-virtuality continuum indistinguishable from corresponding real-world interactions. Yet, todays immersive technology is still decades away from the ultimate display. However, imperfections of the human perceptual, cognitive and motor system can be exploited to bend reality in such a way that compelling immersive experiences can be achieved. In this talk, we will review some mixed reality illusions, which bring us closer to the ultimate blended reality.","Frank Steinicke is professor for Human-Computer Interaction at the Department of Informatics at the University of Hamburg, and chaired the Department from 2017-2020. He studied Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Science at the University of Münster, from which he received his Ph.D. in 2006 and Venia Legendi in Computer Science in 2009. His research is driven by understanding the human perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities and limitations in order to reform the interaction as well as the experience in computer-mediated realities. Frank Steinicke regularly serves as panelist and speaker at major events in the area of virtual reality and human-computer interaction. He is on the International program committee of various national and international conferences in the area of virtual, augmented and mixed reality as well as human-computer interaction, and currently Associate Editor of Frontiers in Virtual Reality. Furthermore, he is a member of the Steering Committee of the ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction (SUI) and the German Informatics Society Special Interest Group on VR/AR.",http://ieeevr.org/2021/assets/images/keynotes/keynote-steinicke.jpg,Maud Marchal

Thinking About Our Future","Thursday, 1 April, 2021",15:30,16:30,WEST UTC+1,"Researchers have been prototyping AR and VR systems for fifty years (longer if we count pre-computer technology). Millions of VR headsets far better than what researchers used just a few years ago are on the heads of home enthusiasts, with consumer AR eyewear soon to follow. Meanwhile, phones and tablets now support AR apps as first-class citizens. WIthin this context, I’ll discuss my thoughts about important directions for our field and what they will mean for our everyday interactions with each other.","<p>Steve Feiner is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, where he directs the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab. His lab has been conducting VR, AR, and wearable computing research for over 25 years, designing and evaluating novel 3D interaction and visualization techniques, creating the first outdoor mobile AR system using a see-through head-worn display and GPS, and pioneering experimental applications of AR and VR to fields as diverse as tourism, journalism, maintenance, construction, and medicine.</p><p>Steve received an AB in Music and a PhD in Computer Science, both from Brown University.
