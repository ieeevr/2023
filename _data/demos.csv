PO1040,Prototyping Large Scale Projection Based Projects in VR,Clarice Hilton: University of Liverpool; Xueni Pan: Goldsmiths; Hankun Yu: none; Richard Koeck: University of Liverpool,"This research develops a technique to simulate large scale immersive installations in VR. The project is a collaboration with Aardman Animations, a world-renowned animation studio developing a projection-based installation. We developed a room-scale VR experience to simulate the installation to visualise the projection distortion under different conditions. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of distortion on the experience of immersion and how three factors effected distortion.",,,

PO1045,Spatially Augmented Reality on Non-rigid Dynamic Surfaces,Aditi Majumder: UCI; Muhammad Twaha Ibrahim: UC Irvine,"We will demonstrate a spatially augmented reality system on non-rigid dynamic surfaces like stretchable fabrics. Using a single projector and RGB-D camera, our system adapts the projection to the changing shape of the non-rigid surface automatically. Such systems have applications in various domains such as art, design, entertainment and medicine. In particular, we we will demonstrate the use of the system as a surgical guidance system for cleft palate surgery using a Simulare cleft model.",,,
PO1047,ARCam: A User-Defined Camera for AR Photographic Art Creation,Xinyi Luo: University of Electronic Science and Technology of China; Zihao Zhu: The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); Yuyang Wang: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Pan Hui: The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,"Photography in augmented reality can be challenging due to the restrictions of pre-defined settings. However, adjustable photography settings and real-time previews are significant for AR photographic creation as creators must adjust multiple camera properties to present unique visual effects. In this work, we designed an AR camera (ARCam) with various adjustable properties to give users a high degree of freedom for photographic art creation in real-time preview.",,,
PO1032,DENTORACULUS-A gamified Virtual Reality experience for dental morphology learning,Viky Cecilia Camarena Quispe: National University of Engineering; Julio César Cubas Aguinaga: National University of Engineering; Luis Gonzalo Díaz Huaco: National University of Engineering; Jhasmani Tito: Kusillo Games Studio,"Dentoraculus is an educational tool on VR for the teaching of dental morphology whose objective is to train dental students in a didactic and playful way, as well as to complement the teaching of complex theoretical concepts and laboratory training. To enhance the motivation, gamification and storytelling techniques were applied. 3D models of dental pieces were obtained using the photogrammetry technique. Finally, experience was tested with teachers and students, obtaining satisfactory result.",,,
PO1049,Bumpy Sliding: An MR System for Experiencing Sliding Down a Bumpy Cliff,Hiroki Tsunekawa: Tokyo Denki University; Akihiro Matsuura: Tokyo Denki University,"We present an interactive MR system with which a player can experience a cartoon physical scene of stabbing a knife on the wall, while sliding down a bumpy cliff. We developed two devices: one is a wall device that mimics the cliff surface; and the other is a knife-shaped device with a retractable blade. The speed of the sliding is controlled using the pressure data obtained by the knife device and the impact of hitting a rock is expressed using a solenoid in the handle of the knife.",,,
PO1048,VRdoGraphy: An Empathic VR Photography Experience,"Kunal Gupta: The University of Auckland; Yuewei Zhang: The University of Auckland; Tamil Selvan G: The University of Auckland; Prasanth Sasikumar: The University of Auckland; Nanditha Krishna: Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Musa Mahmood: OpenBCI, Inc.; Conor Russomanno: OpenBCI, Inc.; Mark Billinghurst: The University of Auckland","This demo presents VRdoGraphy, a VR photography application where the environment and virtual companion adapt to provide empathic interactions. Using the Galea VR HMD with a range of biosensors, we fed the user's EEG, EDA, EMG, and HRV biosignals into a live emotion prediction system estimating the user's emotions. The VR environment and virtual companion adapt their appearance & tone based on the user's emotions. It shows how VR HMDs with integrated biosensors can provide empathic interactions.",,,
