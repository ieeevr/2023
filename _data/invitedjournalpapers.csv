7,A Systematic Literature Review of Virtual Reality Locomotion Taxonomies,,,"The change of the user's viewpoint in an immersive virtual environment, called locomotion, is one of the key components in a virtual reality interface. Effects of locomotion, such as simulator sickness or disorientation, depend on the specific design of the locomotion method and can influence the task performance as well as the overall acceptance of the virtual reality system. Thus, it is important that a locomotion method achieves the intended effects. The complexity of this task has increased with the growing number of locomotion methods and design choices in recent years. Locomotion taxonomies are classification schemes that group multiple locomotion methods and can aid in the design and selection of locomotion methods. Like locomotion methods themselves, there exist multiple locomotion taxonomies, each with a different focus and, consequently, a different possible outcome. However, there is little research that focuses on locomotion taxonomies. We performed a systematic literature review to provide an overview of possible locomotion taxonomies and analysis of possible decision criteria such as impact, common elements, and use cases for locomotion taxonomies. We aim to support future research on the design, choice, and evaluation of locomotion taxonomies and thereby support future research on virtual reality locomotion.","Lisa Marie Prinz; Tintu Mathew; Benjamin Weyers"
8,"Revisiting Walking-in-Place by Introducing Step-Height Control, Elastic Input, and Pseudo-Haptic Feedback",,,"Walking-in-place (WIP) is a locomotion technique that enables users to “walk infinitely” through vast virtual environments using walking-like gestures within a limited physical space. This paper investigates alternative interaction schemes for WIP, addressing successively the control, input, and output of WIP. First, we introduce a novel height-based control to increase advanced speed. Second, we introduce a novel input system for WIP based on elastic and passive strips. Third, we introduce the use of pseudo-haptic feedback as a novel output for WIP meant to alter walking sensations. The results of a series of user studies show that height and frequency based control of WIP can facilitate higher virtual speed with greater efficacy and ease than in frequency-based WIP. Second, using an upward elastic input system can result in a stable virtual speed control, although excessively strong elastic forces may impact the usability and user experience. Finally, using a pseudo-haptic approach can improve the perceived realism of virtual slopes. Taken together, our results suggest that, for future VR applications, there is value in further research into the use of alternative interaction schemes for walking-in-place.","Yutaro Hirao; Takuji Narumi; Ferran Argelaguet; Anatole Lécuyer"
4,Intentional Head-Motion Assisted Locomotion for Reducing Cybersickness,,,"We present an efficient locomotion technique that can reduce cybersickness through aligning the visual and vestibular induced self-motion illusion. Our locomotion technique stimulates proprioception consistent with the visual sense by intentional head motion, which includes both the head's translational movement and yaw rotation. A locomotion event is triggered by the hand-held controller together with an intended physical head motion simultaneously. Based on our method, we further explore the connections between the level of cybersickness and the velocity of self motion through a series of experiments. We first conduct Experiment 1 to investigate the cybersickness induced by different translation velocities using our method and then conduct Experiment 2 to investigate the cybersickness induced by different angular velocities. Our user studies from these two experiments reveal a new finding on the correlation between translation/angular velocities and the level of cybersickness. The cybersickness is greatest at the lowest velocity using our method, and the statistical analysis also indicates a possible U-shaped relation between the translation/angular velocity and cybersickness degree. Finally, we conduct Experiment 3 to evaluate the performances of our method and other commonly-used locomotion approaches, i.e., joystick-based steering and teleportation. The results show that our method can significantly reduce cybersickness compared with the joystick-based steering and obtain a higher presence compared with the teleportation. These advantages demonstrate that our method can be an optional locomotion solution for immersive VR applications using commercially available HMD suites only.","Zehui Lin; Xiang Gu; Sheng Li; Zhiming Hu; Guoping Wang"
