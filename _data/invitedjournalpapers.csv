JInvited01,Virtual Co-Embodiment: Evaluation of the Sense of Agency while Sharing the Control of a Virtual Body among Two Individuals,,,"In this paper, we introduce a concept called ""virtual co-embodiment"", which enables a user to share their virtual avatar with another entity (e.g., another user, robot, or autonomous agent). We describe a proof-of-concept in which two users can be immersed from a first-person perspective in a virtual environment and can have complementary levels of control (total, partial, or none) over a shared avatar. In addition, we conducted an experiment to investigate the influence of users' level of control over the shared avatar and prior knowledge of their actions on the users' sense of agency and motor actions.","

JInvited02,Evaluating the Effects of Non-isomorphic Rotation on 3D Manipulation Tasks in Mixed Reality Simulation,,,"Non-isomorphic rotation has been considered an effective approach for 3D rotation tasks. However, it is not clear whether non-isomorphic rotation can benefit 6-DOF manipulation tasks. Our paper extends the studies of non-isomorphic rotation from rotation-only tasks to 6-DOF manipulation tasks and analyzes collected data using a 2-component model. With a mixed reality simulation approach, we also explore whether environment (AR or VR) has an impact on manipulation tasks. We find that only dynamic non-isomorphic rotation is significantly faster than isomorphic rotation, and environmental visual realism can be helpful to improve user experience.","Zihan Gao: Harbin Engineering University; Huiqiang Wang: Harbin Engineering University, Peng Cheng Laboratory, China; Hongwu Lv: Harbin Engineering University; Moshu Wang: Harbin Engineering University; Yifan Qi: Communication University of China."
JInvited03,Impact of Information Placement and User Representations in VR on Performance and Embodiment,,,"We evaluated the processing of visual stimuli depending on their location in 3D space and the experienced user representation during interaction (i.e., hands, controllers, keyboard). Participants executed a motor task in VR, while simultaneously detecting visual stimuli appearing at different locations. We found that independently of how the user is represented, detection performance is higher when visual stimuli are presented near the user's body, while actively engaged in a motor task. Further, motor performance and embodiment are enhanced by controllers and hands, in contrast to keyboard control. This study contributes to better understanding the detectability of visual content in VR.","Sofia Seinfeld: Universitat Politècnicade Catalunya, University of Bayreuth; Tiare Feuchtner: Aarhus University; Johannes Pinzek: University of Bayreuth; Jörg Müller: University of Bayreuth."
JInvited04,Collaborative Work in Augmented Reality: A Survey,,,"Multi-user AR has received limited attention from researchers, even though AR has been in development for more than two decades. We present the state of existing work at the intersection of AR and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work, by combining a systematic survey approach with an exploratory, opportunistic literature search. We categorize 65 papers along the dimensions of space, time, users’ role symmetry, users’ technology symmetry, and output and input modalities. We derive design considerations for collaborative AR environments, and identify research topics that deserve further investigation.","Mickael Sereno: Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France; Xiyao Wang: Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France; Lonni Besançon: Linköpings Universitet; Michael J Mcguffin: Ecole de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec; Tobias Isenberg: Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France."
JInvited05,Visual Quality of 3D Meshes With Diffuse Colors in Virtual Reality: Subjective and Objective Evaluation,,,"3D graphics with appearance attributes are well-known for providing high degree of realism and allowing six-degrees-of-freedom interactions in immersive environments. These data are subject to processing operations, resulting in a quality loss of final rendered scenes. Thus, both subjective and objective studies are needed to understand and predict this visual loss. In this work, we introduce a large dataset of 480 animated meshes with diffuse colors, produced in virtual reality. Our dataset allowed us to explore the factors influencing subjective opinions. Based on these findings, we propose the first quality metric for meshes with diffuse colors, which works entirely on mesh domain.","Yana Nehmé: CNRS, LIRIS, France; Florent Dupont: CNRS, LIRIS, France; Jean-Philippe Farrugia: CNRS, LIRIS, France; Patrick Le Callet (Fellow, IEEE): CNRS, LS2N, France; Guillaume Lavoué (Senior Member, IEEE): CNRS, LIRIS, France.

JInvited06,Output-Sensitive Avatar Representations for Immersive Telepresence,,,"We propose a system design and implementation for output-sensitive reconstruction, transmission and rendering of volumetric avatars (3D video avatars) in distributed virtual environments. In our immersive telepresence system, users are captured by multiple RGBD sensors connected to a server that performs geometry reconstruction based on viewing feedback from remote telepresence parties. This feedback and reconstruction loop enables visibility-aware level-of-detail reconstruction of volumetric avatars regarding geometry and texture data. Our evaluation reveals that our approach leads to a significant reduction of reconstruction times, network bandwidth requirements and round-trip times in many situations.","Adrian Kreskowski: Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar; Stephan Beck: Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar; Bernd Froehlich: Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar."
JInvited07,Self-Illusion: A Study on Cognition of Role-Playing in Immersive Virtual Environments,,,"We present the design and results of an experiment investigating the occurrence of self-illusion and its contribution to realistic behavior consistent with a virtual role in virtual environments. Self-illusion is a generalized illusion about one's self in cognition, eliciting a sense of being associated with a role in a virtual world, despite sure knowledge that this role is not the actual self. We validate and measure self-illusion through an experiment where each participant occupies a non-human perspective and plays a non-human role. There is some evidence that self-illusion can be considered a novel psychological component of presence.",Sheng Li: Peking University; Xiang Gu: Peking University; Kangrui Yi: Peking University; Yanlin Yang: Peking University; Guoping Wang: Peking University; Dinesh Manocha: University of Maryland.
JInvited08,3D Curve Creation on and around Physical Objects with Mobile AR,,,"When creating 3D curves on and around physical objects with mobile AR, tracking might be less robust or lost due to camera occlusion or textureless scenes. This motivates us to study how to achieve natural interaction with minimum tracking errors in this case. We contribute an elicitation study on input point and phone grip, and a quantitative study on tracking errors. We present a system for direct 3D drawing with a mobile phone as a 3D pen, interactive correction of 3D curves with tracking errors in mobile AR, and explore two applications of in-situ 3D drawing and direct 3D measurement.","Hui Ye: School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, China; Kin Chung Kwan: Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Germany; Hongbo Fu: School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, China."
JInvited09,Capacitive Sensing for Improving Contact Rendering with Tangible Objects in VR,,,"Standard tracking systems cannot properly track the interaction between the user's hand and a tangible object. As they cannot detect when the hand is actually touching the tangible, when reconstructing the virtual elements’ position, their relative position is often flawn by a remaining virtual gap or interpenetration. Thus, we combine tracking information from a tangible object instrumented with capacitive sensors and an optical tracking system, to improve contact rendering when interacting with tangibles in VR. A human-subject study shows that combining capacitive sensing with optical tracking significantly improves the visuohaptic synchronization and immersion of the VR experience.","Xavier de Tinguy: Univ Rennes, INSA, IRISA, Inria, CNRS; Claudio Pacchierotti: CNRS, Univ Rennes, Inria, IRISA; Anatole Lécuyer: Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA; Maud Marchal: Univ Rennes, INSA, IRISA, Inria, CNRS."
JInvited10,Adapting Virtual Embodiment through Reinforcement Learning,,,"In Virtual Reality, having a virtual body opens a wide range of possibilities like partially manipulate the displayed avatar movement through some distortion to make the overall experience more enjoyable and effective (e.g. training, exercising, rehabilitation).  However, an excessive distortion may become noticeable and break the feeling of being embodied into the avatar.  Thus, we propose a method taking advantage of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to efficiently adapt our system to each individual. We show through a controlled experiment with subjects that the RL method finds a more robust detection threshold compared to the adaptive staircase method.","Thibault Porssut: Immersive Interaction Research Group, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland; Yawen Hou: Immersive Interaction Research Group, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland; Olaf Blanke: Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland; Bruno Herbelin: Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland; Ronan Boulic: Immersive Interaction Research Group, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland."
