MASSXR,Multi-modal Affective and Social Behavior Analysis and Synthesis in Extended Reality (MASSXR),,,,"The objective of this workshop on Multi-modal Affective and Social Behavior Analysis and Synthesis in Extended Reality is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the field of social and affective computing with the ones on 3D computer vision and computer graphics/animation and discuss the current state and future directions, opportunities, and challenges. The workshop aims to establish a new platform for the development of immersive embodied intelligence at the intersection of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR). We expect that the workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers to develop new techniques and will lead to new collaboration among the participants.

VR4Exergame,First Workshop on VR for Exergaming (VR4Exergame),,,,"VR exergames have potential to enable a broad spectrum of users to participate in fitness and rehabilitation activities in immersive social environments. Yet, consumer grade VR systems show only limited ability to realize the adoption of VR exergaming at such scale. Key challenges to enable VR as an engaging, interactive and social alternative to existing practices include ¨C therapeutic benefits to fitness and rehabilitation activities; human factors including the ability to simulate real-world scenarios, long term usage comfort among others; and technical capabilities such as simplified system setup, low multi-user latency, and realistic whole-body immersion. This full-day workshop will bring researchers and industry practitioners together to discuss these new emerging research challenges and technologies. It will consist of keynote speakers, juried paper presentations, and a panel discussion. We invite authors to submit 6-page (plus 1-page for references) research or position papers.",Bhawna Shiwani,https://altecresearch.com/vr4exergame/
