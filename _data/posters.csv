C2008,Poster,Evaluating User Acceptance using WebXR for an Augmented Reality Information System,Fabian Meyer: Hochschule Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences; Christian Gehrke: Hochschule Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences; Michael Schäfer: Institute Computer Science,"Augmented Reality has a long history and has seen major technical advantages in the last years. With WebXR, a new web standard, Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications are now available in the web browser. This eliminates one of the biggest obstacles for users in accessing advanced, markerless AR environments on the smartphone, as it makes installing additional software obsolete. Through the prototypical implementation of an AR information system in the form of a web app and a case study, we were able to show that this relatively new browser API can indeed be used for such complex application areas.",https://youtu.be/Y87TMRBHdPQ,Expo Hall A,E23

As the virtual environment's quality of rendering fidelity increases dramatically, it is leading to the neglect or simplification of the physical environment. This paper presents an experiment that explored the effects of an elevated physical platform with a virtually heightened environment to induce stress. Fifteen participants experienced four different conditions of varying physical and virtual heights. Participants reported significantly higher stress level when physically elevated regardless of the virtual height which suggests that the inherent elevation will induce more stress within participants.",https://youtu.be/T7oMJYf2fzo,Expo Hall B,E42

This study conducted experiments to measure users’ adaptation to pulse ejection odor display by ink-jet devices and analyzed the individual differences in olfactory perception. The results revealed that the average intensity perception dropped approximately to 70% of max perceived intensity in the 10-minute scent display session. Furthermore, individuals’ adaptation levels were correlated to personal sensitivity to olfactory intensity variations acquired by labeled magnitude scale.

As opposed to touch screens, there is no physical contact point between the display and the fingers in mid-air pinching, which means the positional relationship between the target point for zooming and the users' finger movement in mid-air pinching could be different from that of touch screens. In this study, we investigated the relationship in mid-air pinching to estimate the target point from the hand posture, and found that the point was significantly off towards the thumb and away from the index finger (approximately 7% offset). This finding contributes to a more accurate mid-air zooming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtEUTStBLCc&feature=youtu.be,Expo Hall B,E28

Research shows, that not only technological immersion, but also person-specific factors, influence the sense of presence. These factors may cause an individual presence tendency (IPT) that affects how presence is experienced. This paper investigates if an IPT exists, how it can be calculated, and what factors influence it.

However, how the camera height of mid-air 360° videos affects user experience is unclear. The study explores whether the camera's height affects users' immersion, presence, and realism. Results suggest that when the camera height is higher, immersion decreases for acrophobic people while first drops and then rises for others because of the broad vision and beautiful scenery. Higher camera height brings a higher presence and worse realism, especially in distance details.

The teaching of this process today is done on physical optical benches, which are often too expensive for students to purchase. One way of circumventing these costs is to use software to simulate the optical bench. This work presents a virtual optical bench, which leverages realtime ray tracing in combination with VR rendering to create a teaching tool which creates a repeatable, non-hazardous and feature-rich learning environment. The resulting application was evaluated in an expert review with 6 optical engineers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcEVg-9ITiY,Expo Hall A,E37

Jackson: University of Surrey,"As audio-visual systems increasingly bring immersive and interactive capabilities into our work and leisure activities, so the need for naturalistic test material grows. New volumetric datasets have captured high-quality 3D video, but accompanying audio is often neglected, making it hard to test an integrated bimodal experience. Designed to cover diverse sound types and features, the presented volumetric dataset was constructed from audio and video studio recordings of scenes to yield forty short action sequences. Potential uses in technical and scientific tests are discussed.",https://youtu.be/NKt5dlwLHoY,Expo Hall A,E35

In addition to this digitization step, we also include a second one where the digitized images are analyzed, tagging them with meta-data pertaining their presumed socio-historical context and their date. The addition of such meta-data is key not only from a cataloguing point of view, but also from a conservation perspective. In fact, analog photos are more often preserved when their subject and their date is known. To this aim, we experiment the use of the HoloLens 2 along with artificial intelligence paradigms.",https://youtu.be/c69sIu9w0IM,Expo Hall A,E33

Schulz: Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics FKIE","Unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) with differing degrees of autonomy are increasingly used for routine tasks, albeit still widely controlled through teleoperation in safety-critical contexts. We propose to complement a traditional approach of showing camera views on a 2D screen with an immersive Virtual Environment (VE), displaying camera data with depth cues around a model of the robot. Combining both approaches with a wearable sensor jacket, the operator can choose the best one for the current task. Preliminary experiments showed that even untrained operators can successfully solve pick and place tasks with high accuracy with our system.",https://youtu.be/9c4p29mzR6M,Expo Hall A,E27

Edward Swan II: Mississippi State University,"For optical, see-through augmented reality (AR), a new method for measuring the perceived 3D location of a virtual object is presented. The method is tested with a Microsoft HoloLens, and examines two different virtual object designs, whether turning in a circle disrupts HoloLens tracking, and whether accuracy errors found with a HoloLens display might be restricted to that particular display. Turning in a circle did not disrupt HoloLens tracking, and a second HoloLens did not suggest systematic errors restricted to a specific display.
