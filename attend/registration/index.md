<h2>Registation FAQ</h2>
<ol>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>How many papers/publications can be valiated by one author registration?</strong><br/>
        Each registered author can validate only one paper/poster/demo/video/3DUI contest/workshop paper/tutorial/DC. <br/>For example, if you have one conference and one demo, you need a "Paper Author Registration" and a "Demo Author Registration" to validate both. In the register system, you should select <u>only one contribution each time</u>. <br/>Although mutiple "Author Registration" can be covered by one name, we encourage registrations followed by different names for promoting interactions among the community.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>Can an author register as a "General Participant", while he/she actually presents a paper?</strong><br/>
        Yes. As long as the paper has one author registered as "Paper Author Registration" to validate the paper, another registered participant can present the paper.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>I am invited to present a paper previously published on TVCG. What category should I register as?</strong><br/>
        You should use the same category as "Paper Author Registration".</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>What number should I provide to register as an invited TVCG paper author? </strong><br/>
        You should indicate your full Paper DOI, eg: 10.1109/TVCG.20nn.ddddddd (as listed on TVCG).</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>What is an Invited TVCG paper?</strong><br/>
        Invited TVCG papers are those manuscripts previously published on IEEE TVCG and invited for oral presentation at the conference. Not to be confused with IEEE VR 2023 Journal Papers published in the special issue.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>Why I can't open the registration system after I clicked the register button?</strong><br/>
      It may need a few minutes to open the registration system for the first time.</li>
    <li style="color: #F5725E:"><strong>Why I can't click the "Pay" button although I have filled out the form correctly?</strong><br/>
      The "Pay" button is inactive unless the server confirms the form is filled out. Usually, the confirmation is done automaticly in a minute. For uploading a digital copy of Student ID, you may wait a couple of minutes for the server to receive the registration data.</li>
