    <h3 style="color: #00aeef;">Description</h3>
    <p>
        Research on the existence and nature of implicit bias has generated a significant amount of attention in psychology and other social sciences over the past few decades. Considerable scientific and policy interest in prejudice reduction and bias interventions date all the way back to such classic texts as Gordon Allport’s The Nature of Prejudice (1954), where intergroup contact theory as an approach to prejudice reduction was first introduced.  Thousands of hours and millions of dollars have been invested developing and implementing a wide variety of anti-discrimination and anti-bias training programs in different organizational and educational contexts. The efficacy of these efforts, and the conditions under which they are effective and for how long, continues to be an issue at the forefront of research on bias mitigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        This panel assembles a diverse group of experts to discuss the opportunities and challenges in designing, developing, deploying, and assessing the effectiveness of VR-based interventions as a relatively new and novel approach to addressing implicit bias and related constructs including racial empathy and structural competence.

        Dr. Domna Banakou completed her PhD in Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology at the University of Barcelona in 2017. She also holds a Master’s degree in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging from University College London (UCL), UK, and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Ionian University, Greece. She combines technical expertise and experience in research methodologies to understand and promote the use of virtual reality in the fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Her research focuses on body representation in immersive virtual reality, exploring the perceptual, behavioral, and higher-level cognitive correlates of body ownership illusions that occur as a function of the type of body in which embodiment occurs. Embodying a different race body and studying implicit bias is of particular interest in her work, where she has previously addressed the longer-term effects of these experiences but also the impact of the social context of the VR scenario on shaping such implicit attitudes.

    <p>
        XR is undergoing rapid development at a time of societal transformation. Will the arts be a driving force and determining factor for the future of immersive technologies? Virtual experiences emerged as a primary mode of engaging with each other and the arts in 2020.  Experiencing the world from our homes has compelled us to delve deeper into our humanity and the power of virtual and immersive technology to bridge our physical, social and emotional connections. Artists and technologists are collaborating to create new modalities of expression and societal impact through XR. This panel explores the multiple perspectives of artists, industry, and technologists in shaping the future of XR in the arts, culture and entertainment.

    <h3 style="color: #00aeef;">Description</h3>
    <p>
        Humans are social beings, and even in VR we typically do not want to be alone. As VR becomes increasingly utilized for a wide range of applications, virtual humans are expected to play increasingly important roles.  A lot of research has concentrated on making virtual humans look and move photo-realistically. Here we argue that the fundamental question is what makes virtual humans effective, in the sense that people respond to them in a way that is useful for and predicted by the application. For example, if the purpose of the application is to make people laugh, then no matter how photorealistic or how expressive the virtual humans involved might be, if the human participants do not laugh then the application would have failed. So, the question shifts from ‘How realistic can we make these virtual humans’ to ‘How should the virtual humans look and behave in order to make you laugh as a human comedian would’ - which may not require high levels of animation realism and photorealism.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this panel, we will discuss the theoretical background behind how effective responses might be elicited by virtual humans and the methodologies used to measure the impact they have on participants. We suggest that in VR the most important question about a virtual human is not: “does it look real”, but “do participants respond to it as if it were a real human”. For example, does the virtual psychotherapist contribute to your wellbeing? This shifts the focus from issues intensively studied in the computer graphics and animation communities to questions that are unique to VR. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We will discuss how eliciting realistic responses is related to all levels of virtual human design and development:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>With respect to appearance, are there some factors more important than others in order to elicit realistic responses?</li>
        <li>In terms of character animation, what are the key features required of a virtual human to be plausible and thus trigger more realistic responses?</li> 
        <li>When it comes to multimodal integrated behavior, such as combined gesture, speech, and facial expression -- what are the key factors that could help maintain consistency? </li>
        <li>Because VR is interactive, virtual humans have to be responsive to user inputs in real-time. However, human inputs are rich and sometimes very subtle. What is the best practice here?</li>
        <li>One of the key application areas for virtual humans is training. For instance, medical students could be routinely spending 1-2 hours with virtual patients to practise their consultation skills. In this situation, the question is: how do you get humans to want to spend time with virtual humans? How does one frame interactions with virtual humans so people know how and why they should interact with them?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Finally, as our essential question for any VR application involving virtual humans is: “do participants respond to them as if they were real?” We will wrap up our discussion with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give one example of a novel measurement you used that provides convincing evidence that participants did respond towards it as if it were real.</li>
    </ul>
