    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This year, the IEEE VR 2023 will hold the 13th annual 3DUI Contest. It is open to anyone interested in 3D User Interfaces (3DUIs) and Virtual Reality, from researchers to students, enthusiasts, and professionals. The purpose of the contest is to stimulate innovative and creative solutions to challenging 3DUI problems. The theme of this year is <strong> “Arts, Science, Information, and Knowledge - Visualized and Interacted”</strong>. Participants need to create and submit an original 3DUI project. This may include VR/AR/MR driven 3DUI systems that IEEE VR attendants can run with their own devices. You have to create an environment that will allow people to visualize and interact with the chosen topic areas. The challenge for this year is for the contestant to implement some well-known 3DUI techniques (e.g, Casting, Go-Go interaction technique, PRISM, WIM, SQUAD) and extend its capability to be more effective and efficient in the proposed application. Due to the current situation, we specifically do not request or make it a prerequisite to include user evaluations.
    </p>

    <p>We expect the following functionality:
        <ul>
            <li>One or multiple potential users should be able to interact in the 3DUI environment</li>
            <li>Teams should provide a downloadable version for IEEE VR attendants</li>
            <li>The project should present novel 3DUI techniques and focus on a technical contribution</li>
            <li>A classic 3DUI technique should be included and adapted for the specific use case (for examples, see:<a href="https://youtu.be/-xKwjYYlpCE">https://youtu.be/-xKwjYYlpCE</a>) </li>
            <li>The simulation could be played standalone, or networked. A user should be able to experience the application for at least 7 minutes time</li>
            <li>Optionally, the project could include an evaluation or the reporting of performance metrics </li>
            <li>Optionally, the system could be collaborative</li>
            
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Selected contestants will be required to provide a runnable demonstration of their solutions using some standard mixed reality hardware (VR, AR). A winner of the 3DUI contest will be selected by a jury at the conference.
    </p>

    <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
        The 3DUI Contest is open to anyone interested in 3DUIs — researchers, students, hobbyists, professionals, or anyone else. Requirements for the selection and presentation are specified below.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
    <p>
        The submitted solutions have to fulfill the following rules to be considered for acceptance and presentation during IEEE VR 2023: 
        <ul>
            <li>Submissions have to present a 3DUI solution:
                <ul>
                    <li>Which covers the topics of <strong> “Arts, Science, Information, and Knowledge - Visualized and Interacted”,</strong> more features or unlisted features are encouraged. It will be considered in the evaluation phase. rm</li>
                    <li>Describe which of the 3DUI techniques has/have been extended. </li>
                    <li>Projects must be submitted with a video (between 3 and 5 minutes) and compiled version. </li>
                    <li>Compatible with OpenXR standard (<a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">https://www.khronos.org/openxr/ </a>). </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The developed 3DUI should
                <ul>
                    <li>… be innovative and technically sound,</li>
                    <li>… provide high usability,</li>
                    <li>… be aesthetically pleasing, and</li>
                    <li>… be enjoyable and thought-provoking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>
    Teams of up to <strong>ten people</strong> may submit solutions.
</p>
    
<h2 id="paper">Paper</h2>
<p>
Teams must submit a short paper of two pages, with a description of the solution, details about software developed, a brief description of the closest related work and how your system is novel, and a description of how you iterated upon the design. 
If your submission is accepted, this paper will be included in the IEEE VR Conference proceedings as an extended abstract describing the contest solution, and therefore must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society format as specified for VR conference papers.
</p>

<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<p>
    Teams will also submit a video that presents the solution to the public, including an explanation of the equipment, software, and interaction techniques used to solve the problem. If your submission is accepted, the video will be made publicly available. Videos should have a length of <strong>approximately 4 minutes</strong> and should include the title along with the names and affiliations of the contestants. The submitted file should be a high quality compressed video with a size of no more than 300 MB and submitted via the submission system or a link to an unlisted youtube video/alike.
</p>

<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>
If your submission is accepted, you will participate in an (online) demo session at the conference, where you will showcase your work to the IEEE VR community and have a chance to win awards. Since this year's contest will be judged at IEEE VR, we will invite various judges from the community to judge your solution. The judging criteria are <strong>novelty, sophistication and elaboration, relevance of the topic,</strong> and <strong>aesthetics</strong>. We will further offer on-site judging for all conference attendees.Contestants are expected to have their set-up prepared for demoing their individual solutions on site or remotely during the 3DUI session as part of IEEE VR.
</p> 
<p>
The final score will be the combination of the expert judges’ score plus the audience scores. The winning team with the highest score will be awarded.
