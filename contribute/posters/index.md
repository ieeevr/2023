    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 29th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2022 seeks poster submissions, which describe recently completed 
        work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications, in all areas related to virtual reality, 
        augmented reality, mixed reality, and 3D user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Presenting a poster is a great way to get feedback on work that has not yet been published. As the conference will take place virtually
        a remote poster presentation will be part of the conference, with sessions for interactive discussion between presenters and attendees for at
        least two days where authors can orally present a brief summary of their work to all conference attendees.
        Note that, in order to maintain interactive and exciting poster presentations, we require at least one presenter per accepted poster to attend the virtual conference.
 </p>

<p>
It is currently not decided which online platform will be used for the online conference. We are aware of the fact that this is of essential interest especially for poster presenters and will inform all authors as soon as we have more information.

    </p>
    
    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Submissions to the poster track must be written in English. The submission must be in the form of a two-page summary paper 
        (references included) with a maximum 100-word abstract. The submitted paper must be in PDF format with embedded fonts. Two-page 
        papers will be included in the proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library, and therefore must be formatted 
        using the IEEE Computer Society format described at <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>. 
        Poster papers must be submitted through a special poster track available at the online submission site - 
        <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions</a>. Supplemental materials, 
        such as a video or image, can be uploaded to the submission site as well, but not mandatory. Every submission will get 
        one (single-blind) review by a poster chair and will be discussed among all poster chairs for the final decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        For every accepted paper there is the requirement to additionally submit a 30-second teaser video, a teaser 
        image (landscape, 1920 x 1080, jpg or png) and  prepare a google slide poster presentation for the virtual conference (either consisting of multiple slides or just one slide designed like a landscape poster). A video does not require sound but would have captions. Detailed instructions 
        about the format of the final posters will be provided to the authors later. 
    </p>
